HikingGuide
===========

A guide that will help you in your hikes with maps, tracks and GPS position.

Hiking Guide is a web app written in HTML, Javascript and CSS, and has been tested on Firefox.

It can show:

- Maps: If online, it shows maps from OpenStreetMap and Google (physical, streets, hybrid and satellite).

- Tracks: It can show a downloaded track. It works with GPX and KML tracks. On a Firefox OS phone, tracks must be located in a directory called "tracks" in the SD card.

- Position: If GPS is connected, it shows the current position and the path made.

Hiking Guide uses the OpenLayers (http://www.openlayers.org/), Enyo (http://enyojs.com/), OpenStreetMap (http://www.openstreetmap.org) and Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) libraries.
