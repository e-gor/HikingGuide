Hiking Guide
===========

A guide that will help you in your hikes with maps, tracks and GPS position.

Hiking Guide is a web app written in HTML, Javascript and CSS, and has been tested on Firefox.

It can show:

- Maps: If online, it shows maps from OpenStreetMap. And if not on a Firefox OS phone (security constraints do not allow to load external Javascript), it also shows Google Maps (physical, streets, hybrid and satellite).

- Tracks: It can show a downloaded track. It works with GPX and KML tracks. On a Firefox OS phone, tracks must be located in a directory called "tracks" in the SD card.

- Position: If GPS is connected, it shows the current position and the path made.

Hiking Guide uses the OpenLayers (http://www.openlayers.org/), Enyo (http://enyojs.com/), OpenStreetMap (http://www.openstreetmap.org) and Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) libraries.

Hiking Guide has so far been translated to Basque, English, Spanish and French.

Hiking Guide can be run directly using Firefox on any platform in from Github (http://e-gor.github.io/HikingGuide).

On a Firefox OS phone it has to be installed (otherwise the geolocation and sd-card APIs cannot be used). The installation can be done from the Firefox Marketplace (https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/hiking-guide). The Github address redirects there if on a Firefox OS phone.

The source code of Hiking Guide is hosted on Github (https://github.com/e-gor/HikingGuide). Please feel free to collaborate.
